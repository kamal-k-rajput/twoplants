        <h3>Disability and Poverty</h3>

          <p>
            There is a strong bidirectional link between poverty and disability.
            Poverty may cause disability through malnutrition, poor healthcare,
            and dangerous living conditions. Case studies in developing
            countries show that higher disability rates are associated with
            higher rates of illiteracy, poor nutritional status, lower
            immunization coverage, lower birth weight, higher rates of
            unemployment and underemployment, and lower occupational mobility.
            Disability can cause poverty by preventing the full participation of
            persons with disabilities in the economic and social life of their
            communities, especially if the appropriate supports and
            accommodations are not available.

      <p>
        The high numbers of persons with disabilities who are disproportionately
        represented among the worldâ€™s most marginalized groups have a profound
        significance with respect to the implementation of the SDGs. Eighty per
        cent of persons with disabilities live in developing countries, and the
        failure to include and integrate them in all development activities will
        mean failure to achieve the SDGs.
